## :sun_with_face: :full_moon_with_face: Our Timeline:
| Day           | Tasks         |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Wednesday 7/8    | Idea, backend crud with PHP, front end crud with Reactjs, Heroku setup |
| Thursday 7/9      | Attempt toggle edit form, layout/colors/fonts, README.md |


## :dancer: Wins:
- We came up with a workflow that made the most sense to us using trello to split up the work.
- To avoid merge conflicts because of our short timeline for this project, we split up the work load by files.
- We worked together to problem solve bugs together when needed.
- When we had a difficult time with something like launching on Heroku for example, we worked together, read the documentation, and tried things out until we got things working!
- We did a ton of pair programming and it went really well!
- We ended up creating a new class component to put the edit form in. We created a toggle function that we used on our Edit putton to toggle back and forth to show the form. 

## :sweat: Challenges:
- Heroku setup - something we worked through and overcame quickly!
- We had trouble toggling the edit form on and off.

## :blue_book: Sources:
- This helped us a lot with our layout design
